## Overview
For those days when too many video games have been played, or those afternoons when you don't know what to do with your free time, 
SideQuest is here to provide you with immediate activity suggestions in a familiar and nostalgic user interface that will get you up and occupied. 
If the suggested activity is not within your wheelhouse, you can opt to receive a new suggestion, or, once your quest has been completed, add it to your
list of conquered quests to keep track of your activity. Users may also change the interface environment from a quaint meadow setting, to a haunted 
forest, or a grand castle to match the setting they feel most inspired by.

## Project Context
I am currently a student at the Turing School for Software and Design studying front-end engineering. This application was created as my final "Showcase" 
project at the end of the program's third quarter (about 4 months into my coding career), and was completed from planning to deployment in four days.

While the project had to meet a set of parameters set by Turing, I was given the freedom to create the concept, comp design, user personas + stories, 
and iterations. My personal goals for the project included: 
- Full functionality and navigability set by MVP
- 100% Accessibility
- Responsive Layout
- Thorough Error Handling
- Fast Loading Time
- Detailed User Personas
- Cleaning data through Utilities
- Extensive E2E Testing
- Extensive, Agile Planning Process
- Organized and Thorough Management System

Turing's requirements for this project included:
1. Use the technology youâ€™ve been working with over the course of the module to demonstrate mastery of the following:
    - React
    - Router
    - Asynchronous JavaScript
    - End to end testing with Cypress
    - Create personas and user stories to describe your target audience.
2. Work within constraints to deliver a product for your niche audience, which helps solve a problem unique to them.
3. Meet the following core functionalities:
    - Display the data from the API in a way that applies directly to your audience
    - Ability for users to store/manipulate the data displayed in the application, such as favoriting or adding to a list, searching, commenting, etc
    - Multiple views handled by Router
    - Be deployed using Heroku, Surge, or any other similar service
